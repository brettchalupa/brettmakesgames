I've made a bunch of small games. Here are some of my favorites and good places to start.

## SokoWorld

SokoWorld is a Sokoban game for web and PC that I'm currently working on.

## Destroy All Goblins

Destroy All Goblins is an action arcade game. It's what I consider to be my first non-trivial game. It's absolutely inspired by Super Crate Box.

## Minimal Survivors

Minimal Survivors is a prototype in making an action game where enemies swarm after you. I was inspired by Vampire Survivors but wanted something a bit more action-oriented. I made this prototype in a week and often think about how it could be expanded into a larger action game.

## Other Projects

I've worked on a handful of game-adjancent projects: books, educational videos, and open source code.

- [Growing with Godot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0qDutCc8IQgtUXLQB07H4miK6DPvtjTg) — 29 videos about the basics of Godot, culminating in a complete 2D platformer tutorial
- [Building Games with DragonRuby](https://book.dragonriders.community/) — a book on how to code games with Ruby
- [Godot Skeleton](https://github.com/brettchalupa/godot_skeleton) — a template for getting started with Godot games quickly
- [Scale](https://github.com/dragonridersunite/scale) — a template for getting started with DragonRuby Game Toolkit quickly
