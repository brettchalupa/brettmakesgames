Hi, my name is Brett. I make games. Right now I'm a hobbyist game developer, but I have aspirations to try to make it primary vocation.

I started programming games when I was a teenager and consistently have come back to it in my free time for the past 15 years.

I've primarily built a lot of prototypes and small games, and I'm working on improving my skills to take on more complex projects. I'm interested in the programming, art, and design aspects of game development. It's challenging and quite rewarding.

I love sharing what I'm learning, which has resulted in [a YouTube channel about game development](https://youtube.com/@brettmakesgames) and [a book on game programming for beginners](https://book.dragonriders.community/).

I loved Japanese RPGs growing up, in particular the Pok√©mon and Dragon Quest series. Lately I've been enjoying a lot of shmups.

I'm looking forward to sharing my game dev journey here!
